- Function-Based Design:
Each arithmetic operation is implemented as a separate function. This makes the logic reusable and easy to maintain.
- User Interaction Loop:
The calculator runs inside an infinite loop, displaying a menu of operations and asking the user to choose one. The loop continues until the user selects the exit option.
- Input Handling:
The program takes two numeric inputs from the user for each operation. It uses error handling to manage non-numeric inputs and division by zero.
- Operation Execution:
Based on the user's choice, the corresponding function is called and the result is displayed.
- Exit Option:
The user can exit the calculator by selecting the appropriate menu option, which breaks the loop and ends the program.
